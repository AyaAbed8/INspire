INSpire Project that connects people together, built with Next.js and MongoDB


## Install

```
yarn Install
```

## Setup & connect to your MongoDb Database

```
1) change this file name .env.local.tmp to .env.local
2) open .env.local and paste your MongoDB url here :  MONGODB_URI="your-mongodb-uri"
```

## Generate schema and Type

```
yarn generate
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```
yarn dev
```

## Try your Graphql

```
http://localhost:3000/api/graphql
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/graphql.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
